This project represents my ongoing learning experience as I follow a tutorial on barcode scanning using Swift and AVFoundation. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my understanding of the key concepts involved. As I continue to develop my skills and expertise in the area of barcode scanning, I will provide further updates on my progress and any new developments that arise.
